- The course is structured to be completed in less than 10 minutes.

## Course Outline
1. **Understanding mCP and Agentic Workflow**
   - Explanation of what mCP is and the theory behind it.
   - Overview of the agentic workflow involved in mCP servers.

2. **Creating an mCP Server**
   - Guidance on creating an mCP server using Python.
   - The server will enable AI assistants to check the latest documentation of libraries before suggesting code.

3. **Using the mCP Server**
   - Instructions on how to use the created server in Cloud Desktop and Cloud Code.
   - Setup guidance and troubleshooting tips.

4. **Debugging mCP Servers**

## Understanding Agents
- Agents are loops of calls to a language model that simulate a thought process.
- They articulate thoughts, choose actions from available tools, and observe the results of those actions.
- Example: An agent can read emails and summarize them by using tools to fetch and process email content.

## mCP Servers and Protocol
- mCP servers act as toolboxes with a standardized input-output protocol.
- The mCP protocol allows different toolkits to be interchangeable and accessible to various AI assistants.
- The protocol enables AI assistants to connect to multiple servers, enhancing their capabilities.

## Creating an mCP Server
- The video demonstrates creating a server that allows AI assistants to access the latest library documentation.
- This ensures that the code suggestions provided by the AI are up-to-date.

## Practical Implementation
- Setting up the environment using UV as a package manager.
- Initializing the project and writing the necessary code to create the mCP server.
