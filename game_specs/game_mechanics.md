Here’s a **detailed breakdown of the core game mechanics** for *Energy Rush: Solar Sprint*, inspired by **Eco** (sustainability), **Factorio** (resource management), and **Overcooked** (cooperative action). These mechanics will define how players collect energy, manage obstacles, and collaborate under pressure.  

---

### **1. Energy Collection Rules**  
**Inspired by Eco (sustainability) and Factorio (resource flow):**  
- **Energy Sources:**  
  - **Solar Panels:** Generate energy when exposed to sunlight. Players must position them optimally (e.g., avoid shadows from storms).  
  - **Wind Turbines:** Generate energy based on wind speed. Players must place them in high-wind zones (e.g., hills or open areas).  
  - **Hydro Dams:** Generate energy from water flow. Players must build dams near rivers or lakes.  
- **Energy Tokens:**  
  - Players collect **energy tokens** (e.g., solar photons, wind gusts, water flow units) that are stored in a virtual grid.  
  - **Storage Limits:** The grid has a maximum capacity. Overloading it causes blackouts (failure condition).  
- **Dynamic Supply:**  
  - Energy production varies based on environmental factors (e.g., solar output drops during storms, wind turbines stop during calm weather).

### **2. Obstacle Management Systems**  
**Inspired by Factorio (automation) and Overcooked (pressure):**  
- **Environmental Hazards:**  
  - **Storms:** Block solar panels, reduce wind turbine efficiency, and flood hydro dams. Players must repair or switch to alternative energy sources.  
  - **Equipment Failures:** Wind turbines or solar panels may randomly malfunction. Players must **repair them** (e.g., click a button or use AI-generated scripts to "fix the turbine").  
  - **Energy Demand Spikes:** Sudden surges in city energy usage (e.g., a factory startup) force players to **prioritize energy distribution**.  
- **Team Coordination:**  
  - **Real-Time Decisions:** Players must collaborate to redirect energy, repair systems, or reroute resources.  
  - **AI-Assisted Fixes:** Use AI tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) to generate scripts for repairing systems or optimizing energy flow.  
- **Failure Scenarios:**  
  - If the grid overloads or the city loses power, the game ends (failure condition).

### **3. Team Roles & Collaboration**  
**Inspired by Overcooked (cooperative action):**  
- **Energy Collectors:**  
  - Tasked with gathering energy tokens from solar, wind, and hydro sources.  
  - Must avoid obstacles (e.g., storms, falling debris).  
- **Grid Managers:**  
  - Monitor energy flow and storage. Must balance supply and demand.  
  - Use AI tools to **simulate energy distribution** (e.g., "Predict the grid’s capacity during a storm").  
- **Engineers:**  
  - Repair broken systems (e.g., fix a turbine, clear a solar panel).  
  - Use AI to **generate code snippets** for system repairs (e.g., "Write a script to restart a turbine").  
- **Strategists:**  
  - Plan routes, prioritize energy sources, and anticipate challenges (e.g., "If the storm hits, we’ll need to switch to hydro").

### **4. AI Integration for Mechanics**  
**To streamline development and gameplay:**  
- **Dynamic Obstacles:** Use AI to generate random events (e.g., "A storm will hit in 5 minutes!").  
- **Code Generation:** GitHub Copilot helps write scripts for energy collection, obstacle handling, or grid management.  
- **Asset Creation:** MidJourney generates visuals for energy sources (e.g., "A solar farm with clouds passing overhead").  
- **Testing:** AI tools simulate edge cases (e.g., "What happens if the storm hits at 5 minutes?").

### **Example Scenario**  
**Mission:** "Power the City Before the Storm Hits!"  
- **Objective:** Collect 100 energy units from solar, wind, and hydro sources.  
- **Obstacles:**  
  - A storm approaches in 10 minutes, blocking solar panels.  
  - A turbine fails, reducing wind energy output.  
  - The city’s energy demand increases by 20% every 2 minutes.  
- **Win Condition:** Deliver 100 energy units to the grid before the storm arrives.
