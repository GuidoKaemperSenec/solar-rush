## 1. Game Design

### 1.1 Core Mechanics
- **Energy Collection**
  - Players gather energy tokens from renewable sources (solar, wind, hydro)
  - Energy storage with limited grid capacity
  - Balancing collection and storage to avoid overloads/blackouts

- **Obstacle Management**
  - Environmental Hazards:
    - Storms blocking solar panels
    - Strong winds damaging turbines
    - Floods disrupting hydro systems
  - System Failures:
    - Equipment malfunctions requiring quick fixes
  - Demand Spikes:
    - Sudden increases in energy usage

- **Team Coordination**
  - Defined roles and responsibilities
  - Real-time decision making critical
  - Collaboration to repair systems, redirect energy, optimize routes

### 1.2 Team Coordination Mechanics
- **Roles & Responsibilities**
  - Energy Collectors: Gather energy tokens
  - Engineers: Repair equipment and manage obstacles
  - Dispatcher: Coordinate team efforts and prioritize tasks
  - Monitor: Track energy levels and system status

- **Communication Systems**
  - In-game chat with voice communication options
  - Visual indicators for player status and task assignments
  - Shared UI elements showing team progress and goals

- **Task Assignment & Prioritization**
  - Dynamic task assignment based on game state
  - Priority levels (urgent, important, routine)
  - Players can request help or delegate tasks

- **Feedback Mechanisms**
  - Real-time feedback on team performance
  - Individual contribution tracking
  - Suggestions for improvement during gameplay

- **Conflict Resolution**
  - Systems to resolve disagreements quickly
  - Automated arbitration for critical decisions
  - Debriefing sessions after each game

### 1.3 UI/UX Design
- Energy meters and collection indicators
- Obstacle warning system with visual alerts
- Team coordination interface showing:
  - Player roles and status
  - Current tasks and priorities
  - Shared goals and progress

## 2. Technical Architecture

### 2.1 Game Engine Selection
- Options: Phaser.js (2D) or Unity (3D)
- Considerations:
  - Development team expertise
  - Performance requirements
  - Cross-platform compatibility

### 2.2 Tech Stack Setup
- Frontend:
  - JavaScript/TypeScript
  - WebGL for graphics rendering
- Backend:
  - Node.js for server-side logic
  - WebSocket for real-time communication
- Database:
  - MongoDB for storing game state and player data

### 2.3 Game Loop Development
- Central loop handling:
  - Energy collection mechanics
  - Obstacle management
  - Team coordination systems
  - State transitions between phases

## 3. Test & Deploy

### 3.1 Unit Testing
- Test individual components:
  - Energy collection mechanics
  - Obstacle management systems
  - Team coordination features

### 3.2 Integration Testing
- Test subsystem interactions:
  - Energy flow from collection to distribution
  - Team collaboration during obstacle management
  - Real-time communication functionality

### 3.3 Deployment Pipeline
- CI/CD setup for:
  - Automated testing
  - Build and deployment
  - Monitoring and analytics

## Conclusion
This implementation plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for developing "Energy Rush: Solar Sprint". By focusing on core game design elements first, we ensure a solid foundation before moving into technical development and deployment phases.
