*   **Key Activities & Deliverables:**
    1.  **Game Engine Selection (Decision Point):**
        *   Evaluate options (e.g., Phaser.js for 2D, Unity for 3D) based on team expertise, performance requirements, and cross-platform compatibility as noted in `energy_rush.md`.
        *   *Deliverable:* Final game engine selection documented in `memory-bank/decisionLog.md`.
    2.  **Tech Stack Setup:**
        *   Set up development environments for frontend (JavaScript/TypeScript, WebGL via engine), backend (Node.js, WebSocket), and database (MongoDB) as per `energy_rush.md`.
        *   Establish version control (e.g., Git repository).
        *   *Deliverable:* Initialized project repository, configured build tools, and set up development/staging environments.
    3.  **Game Loop Development (Initial Implementation):**
        *   Implement the central game loop in the chosen engine.
        *   Develop initial energy collection mechanics.
        *   Implement basic obstacle management logic.
        *   Develop foundational team coordination systems (e.g., role assignment, basic communication).
        *   Implement game state transitions (start, gameplay, end).
        *   *Deliverable:* First playable version with core mechanics implemented.

**Phase 3: Feature Expansion, UI/UX Implementation, and Iteration**

*   **Goal:** Implement all remaining game features, fully develop the UI/UX, integrate art and sound, and iterate based on playtesting.
*   **Key Activities & Deliverables:**
    1.  **Full Feature Implementation:**
        *   Complete all variations of energy collection.
        *   Implement all defined obstacles and their detailed effects.
        *   Fully develop all team coordination mechanics (task system, feedback, conflict resolution).
    2.  **UI/UX Implementation:**
        *   Translate wireframes and mockups into functional UI within the game engine.
        *   Implement all visual indicators, alerts, and feedback systems.
    3.  **Backend & Database Integration:**
        *   Ensure robust handling of game state, player data, and real-time communication.
    4.  **Art Asset & Sound Design Integration:**
        *   Integrate final 2D/3D art assets.
        *   Integrate sound effects and music.
        *   *(Note: Consider AI tool integration for visuals like MidJourney as mentioned in `memory-bank/progress.md` if applicable).*
    5.  **Playtesting & Iteration:**
        *   Conduct regular internal (and potentially external) playtesting sessions.
        *   Gather feedback and iterate on game design, mechanics, and UI/UX.
        *   *Deliverable:* Iteratively improved game builds, playtest reports, and updated GDD.

*   **Key Activities & Deliverables:**
    1.  **Unit Testing:**
        *   Write and execute unit tests for individual components (energy collection, obstacle management, team coordination) as per `energy_rush.md`.
        *   *Deliverable:* Unit testing framework and comprehensive test suite.
    2.  **Integration Testing:**
        *   Test interactions between subsystems (energy flow, team collaboration, real-time communication) as per `energy_rush.md`.
        *   *Deliverable:* Integration test scenarios and execution reports.
    3.  **Performance Testing & Optimization:**
        *   Profile the game for performance bottlenecks.
        *   Optimize code and assets for target platforms.

        *   Deploy the game to target platforms.
        *   *Deliverable:* Deployed game.

**Cross-Cutting Concerns (Applicable throughout all phases):**

*   **Documentation:** Continuously update the GDD, technical design documents, and Memory Bank files (`productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `decisionLog.md`, `progress.md`, `systemPatterns.md`).
*   **Project Management:** Track progress against this plan, manage tasks, and facilitate team communication.
*   **Version Control:** Ensure regular commits with clear, descriptive messages.
