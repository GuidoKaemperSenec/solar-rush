### **1. LLMs as Collaborative Tools**  
**Core Message**:  
> "To use LLMs for code writing, debugging, or documentation, you need to learn how to prompt them with clear, specific, and context-aware instructions."  
**Why**:  
- Example: "Write a Python function for player movement" vs. "Write a function that handles 2D player movement with collision detection."  
- LLMs need explicit details to avoid vague or incorrect outputs.

---

### **2. Automation of Repetitive Tasks**  
**Core Message**:  
> "To automate tasks like test case generation or refactoring, you need to learn how to structure prompts that guide LLMs to identify patterns and apply rules."  
**Why**:  
- Example: "Generate 10 test cases for the login function" vs. "Create test cases for edge cases like invalid passwords, empty fields, and rate limiting."  
- Prompts must define boundaries and expectations.

---

### **3. Rapid Prototyping and Experimentation**  
**Core Message**:  
> "To rapidly prototype or experiment with ideas, you need to learn how to ask LLMs to simulate scenarios, generate scaffolding, or explore alternatives."  
**Why**:  
- Example: "Create a basic multiplayer chat system" vs. "Build a chat system using WebSocket with a 100-player limit."  
- Prompts act as a "sandbox" for testing ideas quickly.

---

### **4. Architecture and Design Assistance**  
**Core Message**:  
> "To get help with architecture or design, you need to learn how to prompt LLMs with high-level goals and constraints (e.g., scalability, security, performance)."  
**Why**:  
- Example: "Design a backend for a multiplayer game" vs. "Design a scalable backend using microservices with real-time data sync and 10,000+ users."  
- Prompts must balance ambition with feasibility.

---

### **5. Testing and Operations**  
**Core Message**:  
> "To use LLMs for testing or operations, you need to learn how to prompt them to simulate edge cases, generate test scenarios, or suggest monitoring strategies."  
**Why**:  
- Example: "Generate test cases for the scoring system" vs. "Create test cases for invalid inputs, network failures, and race conditions in the scoring logic."  
- Prompts must cover both normal and abnormal scenarios.

---

### **6. Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing**  
**Core Message**:  
> "To use LLMs for collaboration, you need to learn how to prompt them to explain complex systems, translate technical jargon, or summarize code for non-technical stakeholders."  
**Why**:  
- Example: "Explain the game’s state synchronization" vs. "Break down how the game handles player data in a 100-player match."  
- Prompts must adapt to the audience’s expertise.

---

### **7. Limitations and Considerations**  
**Core Message**:  
> "To avoid pitfalls, you need to learn how to prompt LLMs with explicit constraints (e.g., safety, security, ethical boundaries) and verify outputs manually."  
**Why**:  
- Example: "Generate a login system" vs. "Create a secure login system with password hashing, rate limiting, and no SQL injection vulnerabilities."  
- Prompts must include guardrails to mitigate risks.

---

### **8. Workshop-Specific Value**  
**Core Messaget**:  
> "To build a playable multiplayer game, you need to learn how to prompt LLMs to generate code, debug issues, and automate tasks while aligning with your team’s goals and constraints."  
**Why**:  
- Example: "Write a multiplayer game" vs. "Build a 2D multiplayer game with 10 players, real-time updates, and a leaderboard."  
- Prompts must match the project’s scope and complexity.

---

### **Final Summary**  
**Core Message**:  
> "The key to using LLMs effectively is not just knowing what to ask, but how to ask it—crafting prompts that guide LLMs to produce accurate, relevant, and actionable outputs for your specific needs."  

This framing ensures participants see **prompting as the bridge** between their goals and the LLM’s capabilities, making the workshop both practical and empowering. Let me know if you'd like to turn this into a slide deck or activity plan!
